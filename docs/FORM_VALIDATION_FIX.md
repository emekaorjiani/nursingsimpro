# Form Validation Fix - Old Input Preservation

## Problem Description

When editing courses or lessons in the admin panel, users were experiencing a frustrating issue where:

1. **Form data loss**: When uploading files (videos, documents) that failed validation, all other form fields would be cleared
2. **Poor UX**: Users had to re-enter all their data after a simple file validation error
3. **Common Laravel issue**: This is a typical problem in Laravel applications when handling file uploads with form validation

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Fixes (AdminController)

All form submission methods now use try-catch blocks to handle validation errors gracefully and preserve old input data.

### Frontend Fixes (CourseDetail.jsx)

The form now properly uses old input data when available and preserves form state on validation errors.

## Key Features

✅ **Old Input Preservation** - All form fields retain their values when validation fails
✅ **File Upload Validation** - Proper validation for video and document files
✅ **User Experience** - Form stays open when validation fails with clear error messages
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of validation exceptions

## Testing

```bash
# Run form validation tests
php artisan test --filter=LessonFormValidationTest

# Create test data
php artisan lesson:test
```

## Benefits

- **No data loss**: Form fields retain values after validation errors
- **Better UX**: Smooth editing experience even with file upload issues
- **Clear feedback**: Specific error messages for each field
- **Time saving**: No need to re-enter data after validation failures
